try [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) it's very well documented there. I'm lazy and it feels pointless to write a story about it. :P

well.. I could write about my experience implementing it. It's awesome (since I have not used Mac OS much, I can't compare to the experience there.). But yeah, I found it to be very useful for multitasking in Ubuntu. :)
