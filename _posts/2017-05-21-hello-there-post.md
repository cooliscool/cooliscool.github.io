##  Welcome to Blogging with jekyll

I was looking forward to experiment with jekyll for long time. As I'm a lazy person, it happened only now.
I think this is pretty cool. As a web developer, I would always like to see and experiment with the code of whatever I'm using, let it be my phone, pc, or blog whatever. I also like to automate stuff. So jekyll seems to be the right recipe for me. Its hackable, as well as many things are automated. Coolest part, I can host it right in github. Wishing good blogging ahead.

**NOTE : ** _forgot this thing : _ I can publish my blog right away by pushing through git. YaaY!

I thought about some things I've done. I thought I should publish it somewhere so that I can come back and look at it , as well as it may help someone else also. So its shit with purpose.
